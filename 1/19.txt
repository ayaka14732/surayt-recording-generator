Barṣawmo, Saro's younger brother, lived in Turabdin until 1995.	Barṣawmo, u aḥuno di Saro u nacimo, hul lan alfo w tšacmo w ḥammëš w tëšci (1995) coyašwa b Ṭurcabdin.	25709.mp3
There, he was doing well economically. He lived a normal life with his family; they did not lack anything.	Tamo ḥal diḏe latwa ḥarbo. Coyašwa ḥaye cadi cam i iqarṯayḏe, mede lo noqaṣwalle.	25710.mp3
However, when he saw that his surroundings were gradually emptying from relatives and friends, he has started to think about moving to Europe with the family as well.	Elo me dë ḥzele ḥeḏore hedi hedi koxole mam more w maḥ ḥawrone, mšarele d mëftakar d hiye ste cam i iqarṯo oṯe l Awrupa.	25711.mp3
After Barṣawmo had consulted with his wife, they decided to move to Germany.	Bëṯër me d u Barṣawmo mšawarle bi aṯto, huwe fusqono d nuqli l Almanya.	25713.mp3
In Berlin they had many relatives and acquaintances, therefore they wanted to move to Berlin.	B Berlin këtwalle more w iḏice ġäläbe, mawxa abici d nuqli l Berlin.	25714.mp3
No sooner said than done. They arrived in Berlin on 1 April 1995.	Hawxa mërre w hawxa sëmme. Maṭën l Berlin ḥa b nisën alfo w tšacmo w ḥammëš w tëšci (1995).	25715.mp3
In Berlin, they were supported by their relatives until they rented a house.	B Berlin mcawni mam moraṯṯe hul d makralle bayto.	25716.mp3
The children started going to school and slowly Barṣawmo and his family settled in Berlin.	An nacime bdalle d ëzzën li madrašto w ëšmo ëšmo u Barṣawmo w i iqarṯayḏe rakiwi b Berlin.	25717.mp3
But Barṣawmo and his wife Ḥana got bored because they did not have a job.	Elo u Barṣawmo w i Ḥana i aṯtayḏe cal d latwalle cwodo, loṯewalle ṣäbër.	25718.mp3
In Turabdin they were used to working. They searched around for a job but they could not find one because they did not know the German language.	Hënne b Ṭurcabdin yalife du cwodo wayne. Karixi harke w tamo cal cwodo, lo mqafalle, miḏe d lišono Almanoyo lëḏciwa.	25719.mp3
Finally, Barṣawmo said: “It cannot go on like this. This does not concern a short period of time. We have to do something.” He said to Ḥana: „Why don’t we open a jewelry shop like the one we had in Midyat?“	Bi ḥarayto u Barṣawmo mërle: “Hawxa lo kowe. Latyo lo yawmo w lo tre. Kolozam saymina mede.” Mërle li Ḥana: “Qay lo kofëtḥinalan dukano du dahwo, xud hayo d këtwaylan b Mëḏyaḏ?”	25720.mp3
Ḥana replied: “It is a good idea, but it is difficult to finance it.“	I Ḥana mërla: “Rënyo kayiso yo, elo az zuze qëṭro ne.”	25721.mp3
Barṣawmo replied: “We will ask our relatives for money; if they support us there won’t be a problem.”	U Barṣawmo mërle: “Gëd ṭëlbina zuze mam morayḏan, häka mcawannallan, lo kofoyaš qëṭro.”	25722.mp3
That is how he and Ḥana borrowed money from their relatives. Their relatives lent them money generously.	Qayëm hiye w i Ḥana azzën mdayanne zuze mam moraṯṯe. Am moraṯṯe ste b iḏo ftëḥto huwanne.	25723.mp3
That is how they managed to open a small jewellery shop.	Hawxa qadiri fëtḥi dukano nacëmto du dahwo.	25724.mp3
Over time the situation of the family improved. They made profits, they paid off their debts and bought a car.	Cam u zabno šuġla di iqarṯo mcadal. Hawëlle zuze, huwe ad dayne w zwënne raḏayto.	25725.mp3
They now live a good life. Their children have learned the language and have made friends.	Fayëš kocayši ḥaye basime. An nacimaṯṯe ste yalifi u lišono w sëmmanne ḥawrone.	25726.mp3
