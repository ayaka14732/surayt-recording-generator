Barṣawmo had a driving licence in Midyat but there he did not have a car that he could drive every day.	U Barṣawmo b Mëḏyaḏ këtwayle sohduṯo du qloco, elo tamo raḏayto latwayle d qolac kul yawmo.	29584.mp3
When he came to Berlin he wanted to get his driving licence converted to a German one, but the municipal administration did not accept it.	Inaqla d aṯi l Berlin abëc d maqlab i sohduṯayḏe lu Almanoyo,  i karxuṯo lo maqbela.	29585.mp3
They told him: „You will have to take theory and driving classes because the traffic is difficult in Germany; it is not like in Midyat.“	Mërralle: “Kolozam qamayto maydat hërge du trafik w du qloco, miḏe d b Almanya u trafik casqo yo, latyo xud Mëḏyaḏ.”	29586.mp3
Therefore Barṣawmo was obliged to enrol in a driving school, in order to learn the traffic regulations and driving in Germany.	Mawxa u Barṣawmo jbir d ëzze l madrašto du qloco, lašan d yolaf aq qonune du trafik w u qloco b Almanya.	29587.mp3
Barṣawmo started taking theory classes.	U Barṣawmo mšarele bu myodo dah hërge du trafik.	29589.mp3
In the beginning, he went to work by bus, sometimes by train or by metro. Thereafter, he bought himself a small motor cylce with which he travelled to and from his work faster.	Bu šuroyo ëzzewa lu cwodo bu baṣo, naqlawoṯe ste bu tren aw bu metro. Bëṯër zwënlele moṭor nacimo, ebe ëzze w oṯewa u cwodayḏe xayëftër.	29590.mp3
The children cylced by bike to school. Ḥana too learned cycling.	An nacime bab bësëkletaṯṯe ëzzënwa li madrašto. I Ḥana ste jbiro d yëlfo qloco du bësëklet.	29591.mp3
This way, overtime they all learned about the traffic regulations in Germany.	Hawxa ëšmo ëšmo yalifi kulle cal aq qonune du trafik d Almanya.	29592.mp3
Barṣawmo continued with taking theory classes. Once a week he also took a driving class.	U Barṣawmo mdawamle bu myodo dah hërge du trafik. Bi šabṯo ste naqla moyadwa hërgo du qloco.	29593.mp3
So, after four, five months he did his exam and got the driving licence.	Hawxa bëṯër arbco ḥamšo yarḥe sëmle buḥrono w mëdle i sohduṯo du qloco.	29594.mp3
Ḥana sagte to him: „Now we have to buy ourselves a car!“	I Ḥana mërlale: “Annaqla këbce zawninalan raḏayto!”	29595.mp3
Barṣawmo said to Ḥana: „We just recently opened the shop, we cannot buy a new car. We will buy a used car until our business is going well.“	U Barṣawmo mërle li Ḥana: “Ucdo i dukano ḥaṯo ftiḥolan, layban zawnina raḏayto ḥaṯto. Gëd zawnina ḥḏo mëstacmalto hul dë mhalax šuġlan ṭawwo.”	29596.mp3
Ḥana said: „you are right, that will do for now.“	I Ḥana mërla: “Xabrux yo, ucdo bas yo elan.”	29597.mp3
Then he and Ḥana went to a car shop, they liked a used car and bought it.	Qayëm hiye w i Ḥana azzën l dukano dar raḏoyoṯe, rḥëmme raḏayato mëstacmalto w zwinalle.	29598.mp3
They completed the paperwork for the purchase, paid for the car and returned home.	Sëmme aw warqe du zwono, huwe ḥaq di raḏayto w daciri lu bayto.	29607.mp3
The day after, Barṣawmo registered it on his name at the municipality.	Deri yawmo azze u Barṣawmo mqaydole bi karxuṯo cal ëšme.	29606.mp3
From that day onwards he drove the car.	Mu yawmawo u Barṣawmo ëzze w oṯewa bi raḏayto.	29605.mp3
One day, when he returned from work he had an accident.	Ḥa yawmo, hiye aṯoyo mu cwodo sëmle gëdšo.	29604.mp3
The police came and looked at his licence and the paperwork of the car.	Aṯi u polis w ḥërle cal i sohduṯayḏe w cal aw warqe di raḏayto.	29603.mp3
Then, the police investigated how the accident happened. In the end, the police put the blame on the other party.	Bëṯër u polis mfatašle be aydarbo hawi u gëdšo. Bi ḥarayto maḥatle u suj cal u gabo ḥreno.	29602.mp3
Barṣawmo got the costs of the accident covered by the insurance of the other person and he got his car repaired.	U Barṣawmo mëdle u maṣraf du gëdšo mi sigorta du ḥreno w masëmle i raḏaytayḏe.	29601.mp3
Ḥana said to Barṣawmo: „From now on be careful when driving!“	I Ḥana mërla lu Barṣawmo: “Mucdo w azolo maḥat bolo inaqla d qulcat raḏayto!”	29600.mp3
Barṣawmo said: „What can I do, it was not my fault!“	U Barṣawmo mërle: “Ma mën soyamno, latwa suj diḏi!”	29599.mp3
