The human body consists of internal organs and external parts.	U gušmo du nošo rakiwo yo me hadome baroye w gawoye.	17837.mp3
Each organ and each part has a specific function.	Kul hadomo këtle woliṯo frëšto.	17838.mp3
The external parts and internal organs complete each other in order for the body to work.	Ah hadome baroye w gawoye komkamli ḥḏoḏe w koṭorën u gušmo cowad.	17839.mp3
If one of these organs or parts is malfunctioning, the body does not develop as it should.	Ḥa mah hadomani d howe kayiwo, u gušmo lo koyoraw xud kolozam.	17840.mp3
Here you see the body of a child.	Harke laltaḥ koḥozitu gušmo dë zcuro.	17841.mp3
Now we will see which are the external parts of the body.	Ucdo gëd ḥozina ayna ne ah hadome baroye du gušmo.	17842.mp3
The human body consists of flesh, bones, skin, muscles and blood.	U gušmo du nošo rakiwo yo me basro, garme, galdo, wariḏe w admo.	17925.mp3
The body can be divided into four main parts: head, abdomen, arms and legs.	U gušmo komifalaġ l arbco falqe rišoye: rišo, gawo, drucone w raġle.	17926.mp3
Together, these form the skeleton of the body.	Hani cam ḥḏoḏe komkamli i skale du gušmo.	17927.mp3
The human skeleton is built from bones. Without it, there is no life because it supports the muscles.	I skale du nošo mag garme rakuto yo. Dlo mena layt ḥaye, miḏe d hiya kobo ḥaylo law wariḏe.	17928.mp3
The bones protect the internal organs of the body so that they will not be hurt if one falls down somewhere.	Ag garme konëṭri ah hadome gawoye (organe) du gušmo dlo mitakiwi inaqla d ḥa qoyaṯ b dukṯo.	17929.mp3
The skin functions as a jacket of the body. It protects the body against diseases.	U galdo šëkël d čaket yo cal u gušmo. Konoṭar u gušmo mak kewe.	17930.mp3
Inside the head is the brain.	Lawġël du rišo kit muḥo.	17931.mp3
The brain controls the whole body. In the head, from the outside, we can see two eyes, two ears, a nose and a mouth.	U muḥo komdabar u gušmo kule. Bu rišo me larwal koḥozina tarte cayne, tarte aḏne, nḥiro w femo.	17932.mp3
Then there are the hands and the feet.	Bëṯër koṯën an iḏe w ar raġle.	17933.mp3
A human being has five senses: sight with the eyes, hearing with the ears, smell with the nose, touch with the hands and taste with the tongue.	U nošo këtle ḥamšo rëġše: ḥzoyo bac cayne, šmoco ban aḏne, nqoḥo bu nḥiro, gyošo ban iḏe w ṭcomo bu lišono.	17934.mp3
In order for the body to function well, we will have to take care of it very well, with food, with water and with clothing.	Lašan du gušmo cowad ṭawwo kolozam d howina le ġalabe moro, bu muklo, w bu štoyo, w bu lwošo.	17935.mp3
