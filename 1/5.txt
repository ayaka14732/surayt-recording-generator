Before Aday became a teacher in a Dutch school, he began to study the Dutch language.	Meqëm d howe u Aday malfono b madrašto Holandayto, mšarele d yolaf lišono Holandoyo.	16829.mp3
While he took a Dutch language course he also learned about teaching methods in the Netherlands.	Azze l dawro du lišono w b cayni zabno yalëf cal u šbilo du yulfono b Holanda.	16830.mp3
This is how Aday prepared himself for work.	Hawxa u Aday mḥaḏarle ruḥe lu cwodo.	16831.mp3
Aday finished the beginner's language course for Dutch before he started working.	U Aday mkamele u dawro šarwoyo du lišono Holandoyo meqëm d cowad.	16851.mp3
In this course, he learned how to introduce himself and how to socialise with people.	Bu dawrano yalëf aydarbo mawḏac ruḥe w aydarbo obe w šoqal cam an noše.	16852.mp3
He also learned many words related to school: pen, notebook, book, board, eraser, teacher, class, bag, table, reading, writing, lesson, exercise and others.

After he became fluent in Dutch he began to search for a teaching position.	Bëṯër me d qadër maxlaṣ ruḥe bu lišono Holandoyo, mšarele d korax cal cwodo di malfonuṯo.	16854.mp3
Now Aday is a teacher. He teaches Surayt in a Dutch school. He has Dutch and Syriac students.	Ucdo u Aday malfono yo. Komolaf Surayt b madrašto Holandayto. Këtle yolufe Holandoye w Suryoye.	16855.mp3
With time Aday is improving his Dutch. He has reserved one day per week for studying the Dutch language.	Cam u zabno u Aday komaqwe u lišonayḏe u Holandoyo. Frëšle le bi šabṯo yawmo dilonoyo lu ylofo du lišono Holandoyo.	16856.mp3
During the class, there are often conversations between the students and the teacher.	Ġalabe kore bu zabno du hërgo kowe mamlo bayn day yolufe w du malfono.	16857.mp3
Karin is one of the Dutch students.	Karin ḥḏo may yolufe Holandoye yo.	16858.mp3
She asks Aday: ‘Where have you learned Dutch?’	Komšaylo u Aday: „Ayko yalifat Holandoyo?“	16859.mp3
Aday answers: ‘Just like you, in the language courses.’	Komfane u Aday: „Ono ste xoṯax bad dawre du lišono yalëfno.	16860.mp3
Aday asks Karin: ‘Why do you want to learn Surayt?’	Hat qay këbcat yëlfat Surayt?”, komšayal u Aday li Karin.	16861.mp3
She says: ‘Because I have Syriac friends; I want to understand them when we are together.’	Hiya këmmo: „Cal d këtli ḥawrone Suryoye, këbcono fëhmanne inaqla d howina cam ḥḏoḏe.“	16862.mp3
Marta is a Syriac student. Aday asks her: ‘Why do you want to learn Surayt?’	Marta yolufto Suryayto yo. U Aday komšayela: Hat qay këbcat yëlfat Surayt?	16863.mp3
She says: ‘Because it is my language.	Hiya këmmo: Cal d këtyo u lišonayḏi.	16864.mp3
My language is part of my identity.	U lišonayḏi falqo mi hiyuṯayḏi yo.	16865.mp3
Besides, it is good to learn something.	Bëṯër ḥa mën d yolaf ṭawwo yo.	16866.mp3
It is said that learning is the second light.’	Këmmi u yulfono u bahro dat tre yo.	16867.mp3
