“Brother if it is not a problem we would like to visit you this Christmas.”	„Aḥuno, iḏa layt këlyono, këbcina bu ceḏano zayrina lxu.“	22321.mp3
His brother says, “Sure, that is not a problem but I will ask the children if they have not planned anything without me knowing. I will then get back to you with an answer.”	U aḥuno komar, „ašër komarno layt këlyono, elo gëd mšayalno an nacime be lo mcayarre mede dlo meni. Bëṯër gëd madcarno xabro aclux.“	23106.mp3
