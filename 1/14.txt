One day after work, Aday came home.	B ḥa yawmo bëṯër mu cwodo aṯi u Aday lu bayto.	22474.mp3
“Hello, my love!” Aday said to Saro.	“Šlomo, ḥabёbto!” mërle u Aday li Saro.	22475.mp3
Saro said with a sad voice, “Hello”	I Saro b lebo twiroyo mërla, “b šayno!”.	22476.mp3
Aday asked, “Why? What is wrong? Is everything alright?”	“Qay? Mën kit? kul mede ṭawwo yo?” mšayele u Aday.	22477.mp3
Saro said, “I don’t know. The wife of my brother Abrohёm, Šušan, called from Midyat and said: ‘your brother is ill.’”	“Mayko këḏcono,“ mërla i Saro. ”I aṯto d aḥuni Abrohёm, i Šušan, mtalfanla me Mëḏyaḏ w mërla ‘aḥunax kayiwo yo!’”	22478.mp3
Aday said, “This is not happy news. However, I hope that it is not something serious.	U Aday mërle, “hano latyo ṭebo mafaṣḥono. Elo bu ḥaylo d Aloho latyo mede yaquro.	22479.mp3
It may be something easy to heal. Do not be sad. Let us call and learn what he has.”	Kowe d howe mede xayifo. Lo mëḥzonat, tax mtalfnina, ḥozina mën këtle.”	22480.mp3
Aday then calls Midyat and asks about his brother-in-law.	Qayëm u Aday komtalfan l Mëḏyaḏ w komšayal cal u barёḥmayḏe.	22505.mp3
The wife of his brother-in-law says, “Yesterday Abrohëm got ill.	I aṯto du barёḥmayḏe këmmo: “Aṯmël mqawmo cal u Abrohëm.	22506.mp3
He said to me, ‘I actually do not feel well, I have a headache, I feel nauseous, I have a fever and my body is shivering.’	Hiye mërle li: ‘Ašër komaḥësno b ruḥi d latno ṭawwo, riši konoqar, lebi komigawlac, këtli ḥëmto w gušmi kule komarcal.’	22507.mp3
I said to him, ‘Yes, if that is how you feel, you should visit the doctor.’	‘E, d howe hawxa kobac d ëzzux lu taxtor,’ mërli le.	22508.mp3
That is how he was brought to the doctor in the afternoon. He was given medication, tablets and syrup.	“E hawxa. Bëṯër me falge d yawmo mtawbal lu taxtor. Hiw ele darmone, ḥappoṯe w šërub.	23100.mp3
He was told, ‘you have to rest. If you do not get better in a week, you should be brought back.’	Mir ele, ‘kolozam mëṯnoḥat. iḏa me ucdo l šabṯo lo nayëḥle, kolozam mitadacar naqla ḥreto lu taxtor.’	23101.mp3
He is now at home laying on the bed.”	Kale ucdo bu bayto mžido cal u taxt.”	22512.mp3
“Can I talk to him?”, asked Aday. “Yes, of course!”	”Kibi mëjġalno acme?” Mërle u Aday. “E, e.”.	22513.mp3
“Hello Abrohëm, how are you?”	“Šlomo Abrohëm, aydarbo hat?”	22514.mp3
“Thank you very much Aday, Šušan has already told you what happened to me”, Abrohëm says.	“Tawdi ġalabe Aday, kala i Šušan maḥkela be mën hawi acmi,” Komar u Abrohëm.	22519.mp3
“Take care of yourself, hopefully you will be better soon”, Aday says.	“Hway moro l ruḥux w Aloho obe lux ḥulmono ṭawwo”, Komar u Aday.	22520.mp3
After a week Saro called Abrohёm‘s family again. She asked her sister-in-law how Abrohёm is doing.	Bëṯër b šabto i Saro mtalfanla naqla ḥreto l be Abrohёm. Mšayela i aṯto du aḥunayḏa, be aydarbo hawi u Abrohëm?	22521.mp3
Šušan said, ”To be honest, he is still the same. Yesterday he was brought to the doctor again.” Saro said, ”and, what was he told?”	I Šušan mërla: “haymën heš hawxa yo. Aṯmël mtawbal naqla ḥreto lu taxtor.” “E, mën mir ele?” Mërla i Saro.	22522.mp3
”After he was examined well, he was transferred to the hospital.”	“Bëṯër me dë mcayan ṭawwo, mḥawal lab beṯ krihe.”	23102.mp3
“There he was told: ‘You have stones in your kidneys. You will have to stay here tonight. Tomorrow we will see what we can do for you.’	“Tamo mir ele ‘kit kefe bak kulyoṯayḏux! Kobac fayšat adlalyo harke d ḥozina ramḥël mën kiban saymina lux.’	23103.mp3
Then a nurse came and took Abrohëm with her to a different room. Last night he slept in the hospital.	Bëṯër aṯyo camšira w mawbela u Abrohëm acma l qelayto ḥreto. Damëx bramšël bab beṯ krihe.	22524.mp3
This morning the doctor came to see him and told him: ‘I will prescribe you tablets because I believe that these tablets will be helpful to your kidneys.’	Adṣafro aṯi u taxtor side w mërle le: ‘Gëd obeno lux ḥappoṯe, miḏe d komašërno baḥ ḥappoṯani ak kulyoṯayḏux gёd howën ṭawtër.’	22525.mp3
And so we took the tablets and returned home.”	E hawxa, mëdlan aḥ ḥappoṯe w dacirina lu bayto”.	22526.mp3
“Can I talk to him?” Saro asked.	“Kibi mëjġolono acme?” Mërla i Saro.	22527.mp3
“Yes, here you have him.”	“E, kale mëdlax yo.”	22518.mp3
“How are you brother?”	“Aydarbo hat kako?”	22517.mp3
“Thank you very much, little by little I’m doing better,” Abrohëm said.	“Tawdi ġalabe, hedi hedi koweno ṭawtër,” mërle u Abrohëm.	22516.mp3
Saro answered, “Very good, get well soon. Bye.”	“Ġalabe ṭawwo,” mërla i Saro,” ḥulmono ṭawwo. Fëš bë šlomo”.	22515.mp3
