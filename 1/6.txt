Saro and Aday work and live in a house in Amsterdam.	I Saro w u Aday cawode ne w koyëtwi b bayto b Amsterdam.	17316.mp3
Because the rent is high they want to buy or build a house.	Cal di këre du bayto celayto yo, këbci zawni bayto aw macamri bayto.	17317.mp3
In the end they have decided to build a house.	Bi ḥarayto markawwe u rëcyonaṯṯe cal tëcmiro d bayto.	17318.mp3
Saro and Aday started to look around for a lot to build on.	I Saro w u Aday mšaralle d kurxi cal arco d macamri.	17335.mp3
They looked here and there and they found a lot in one of the new neighbourhoods of Amsterdam.	Karixi harke w tamo mqafalle arco bë ḥḏo maš šawṯoṯe ḥaṯe d Amsterdam.	17336.mp3
A short time later they went to see an architect and asked him to draw the plan of a house for them.	B zabno karyo azzën gab aršitakt w abici mene d rošam plan d bayto lašanayye.	17337.mp3
The architect drew a plan of a house for them according to their wishes.	U aršitakt ršëmle plan d bayto alle xud abici.	17338.mp3
He showed them the plan of the house and explained it to them:	Maḥwele u plan alle w šrëḥle u mede dë ršëmle:	17339.mp3
The size of the house, the rooms, the garden, the windows, the kitchen, the toilet, the bathroom and anything else needed.	i rabuṯo du bayto, aq qeloyoṯe, i ganṯo, aš šaboke, u maṭbax, i tuwalet, u banyo w kul mede d lozamwa.	17340.mp3
After Saro and Aday agreed about the plan, they went to the municipality to ask for a building permission.	I Saro w u Aday bëṯër me d raḏën cal u plan, azzën li baladiye d ṭëlbi fsoso lu tëcmiro.	17341.mp3
At the same time, they started looking for a construction company.	B cayni zabno ste mšaralle d kurxi cal šërke du tëcmiro.	17342.mp3
The municipality responded within a month and gave them permission.	I baladiye b zabno d yarḥo madcarla xabro aclayye w hula alle fsoso.	17343.mp3
But they could not find a building company quickly, because they talked and negotiated with many companies. In the end they found one.	Elo šërke lu tëcmiro xayifo lo mqafalle, miḏe d mëjġalle w mbayzarre cam šërkat ġalabe. Bi ḥarayto mqafalle ḥḏo.	17344.mp3
After they and the company came to an agreement, Saro and Aday went to search for the building material.	Bëṯër me d hënne w i šërke aṯën lë ḥḏoḏe, i Saro w u Aday azzën dë mnaqën u matëryal du tëcmiro.	17345.mp3
They made their choices about the bricks, the windows, the paint, the wall paper and other things.	Mnaqalle ak kefe, aš šaboke, i boya, u kaġat w ġer medone.	17346.mp3
This is how the company started to build the house. After a year, the house was built.	Hawxa i šërke mšarela bu tëcmiro du bayto. Šafëc mëdde d šato, u bayto camër.	17347.mp3
Then they started decorating the house. Within one month the family of Be Marawge moved into the new house.	Bëṯër mšaralle d malawši u bayto. Lo šafëc yarḥo i iqarṯo d Be Marawge nqila lu bayto ḥaṯo.	17348.mp3
