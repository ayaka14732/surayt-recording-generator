Since the last century, there have been many technological changes and advancements in communication  technology in the world, which we call ‘muṭoyo‘.	Mu doro d šafëc hawi bë briṯo šuḥlofe w šušoṭe ġäläbe bi taknoloġiya du komunikasyon d këmminale muṭoyo.	29232.mp3
Today's communication technology enables us to contact each other in different ways.	U muṭoyo d adyawma koṭore d howelan esore cam ḥḏoḏe b darbone mšaḥlfe.	29233.mp3
One of them is the mobile phone or smartphone.	Ḥa mënne u täläfon di iḏo yo, komitawmarle mobile aw smartphone.	29234.mp3
With the smartphone, one can talk from anywhere, anytime with anyone.	Bu smartphone kibe ḥa me kul dukṯo b kul zabno mëjġal cam man d obac.	29235.mp3
One can also disseminate information about any topic one would wish to inform others about.	W kibe ste ḥa mbarbaz mawḏconwoṯe cal kul ṣbuṯo d obac mawḏac laḥ ḥrene.	29236.mp3
On the smartphone, there is also the possibility to listen and to read the news from around the world.	Kito ste bu smartphone mkono du šmoco w du qroyo daṭ ṭebe me briṯo kula.	29237.mp3
Communication technology brings people closer together through image, through sound and through writing.	I taknoloġiya du muṭoyo komaqarwo an noše lë ḥḏoḏe bi ṣërto, bu qolo w bi kṯawto.	29238.mp3
It gives them the opportunity, via the Internet, to quickly gain in-depth knowledge about things they would like to learn and understand.	Koballe fërṣa bu darbo du nawlo d howalle b zabno karyo iḏacṯo camëqto cal u mede d këbci yëlfile w fëhmile.	29239.mp3
In everyday life, everyone uses a smartphone or mobile phone, a computer or tablet and goes online.	Baḥ ḥaye yawmoye kul nošo komëstacmal adyawma smartphone aw mobile, komputer aw tablet w kocobar lu nawlo.	29240.mp3
It is difficult to be disconnected from technology.	Casqo yo fayëš ḥa d coyaš qṭico mi taknoloġiyaṯe.	29241.mp3
