Saro has been working in the clothes shop for a while. She has gained good experience with buying and selling and	I Saro me zawno kocawdo bi dukano daj jule. Hawila nësyono ṭawwo bu zwono w zebono.	19909.mp3
so she has become a shop manager.	Mawxa hawyo mdabroniṯo li dukano.	19910.mp3
She knows the preferences of the customers and she knows how to interact with them.	Këḏco az zawone mën šëkël jule korëḥmi w aydarbo obo w šuqlo acmayye.	19911.mp3
She is up to date with the fashion in each season and she knows what to offer in the shop.	U šuḥlofo bu šuḥlofo këḏco ayna jule bi moda ne w mën maḥto bi dukano.	19912.mp3
She pays attention to which colours go well together.	Komaḥto bolo cal ag gawne d këzzën cam ḥḏoḏe.	19913.mp3
For example, she puts red and black together, yellow and blue together and so on.	Maṯlo, semoqo w komo cam ḥḏoḏe, šacuṯo w zarqo cam ḥḏoḏe w ġer.	19914.mp3
Saro manages the shop well	I Saro koḥayro ṭawwo cal u ṭukoso d gawa di dukano.	19915.mp3
She sets aside one part for the men, one for the women, one for the children and one for teenagers.	Kofëršo gabo lag gawre, ḥa lan niše, ḥa lan nacime w ḥa lac clayme.	19916.mp3

So she hangs each item organized and nicely in its place.	Hawxa komcalqo kul mede mṭakso w šafiro b dukṯe.	19919.mp3
She puts small items like socks, hats, underwear, necklaces, earrings, bracelets and other things in baskets or on the tables.	Am medone nacime, xud ag gërwe, qubce, jule taḥtoye, qdoše, marwoḏe, šayre w ġer medone komaḥtalle bas sale aw cal aṭ ṭëbloyoṯe.	19920.mp3
