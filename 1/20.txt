Last year Marta graduated.	Ëšqaḏ i Marta maxlaṣla i madrašto.	26232.mp3
This year she has started studying law at the University of Groningen.	Adšato mšarela d quryo zëdqe bu Beṯṣawbo dë Groningen.	26233.mp3
But after a few months, she dropped out of law school because it wasn't what she liked.	Elo bëṯër bë kmo yarḥe mbaṭela i qrayto daz zëdqe, miḏe d latwa u mede d rëḥmowa.	26234.mp3
At the moment she is looking for new study opportunities.	Ucdo kokurxo cal mkone ḥaṯe di qrayto.	26235.mp3
Marta actually wanted to be a doctor first, but she couldn't because she didn't get a place at the university of her choice.	Du šrolo i Marta bi qamayto rëḥmowa d huyo taxtore, elo lo qadiro, miḏe d lo qayëṯla dukṯo bu beṯṣawbo d ëbcowa.	26237.mp3
From the beginning, Marta started studying law with mixed feelings.	I Marta mu šuroyo b lebo fliġoyo mšarewayla bi qrayto daz zëdqe.	26238.mp3
But she didn't like it, therefore she broke it off and lost that academic year.	Elo lo mcajabla, mawxa ṭrela w xaṣiro i šatayo du yulfono.	26239.mp3
Then she thought that she had to do something, in order not to lose the next year as well.	Bëṯër mëftakarla d këbce saymo mede, lašan d lo xuṣro i šato d ëṯyo ste.	26240.mp3
She discussed with her friends and asked advice from a study advisor.	Mëjġela cam aḥ ḥawronayḏa w mšawarla bë mšabloniṯo du yulfono.	26241.mp3
This is how Marta started to prepare herself for the coming year.	Hawxa i Marta bdela dë mḥaḏro ruḥa li šato d ëṯyo.	26242.mp3
During the open days at universities, she attended various fields of study and acquired a broad knowledge about them.	Bay yawme dat tarce ftiḥe dab beṯṣawbe zërla fërce d yulfono mšaḥëlfe w malëmla iḏacṯo rwëḥto aclayye.	26243.mp3
She visited the university in Enschede (with the idea) to study pedagogy; she did not like it. One day she went to the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam to learn about psychology.	Azza li madrašto celayto d Enschede d quryo pedagogi, lo mcajabla. Ḥa yawmo azza lu Beṯṣawbo Ḥiro d Amsterdam dë mšaylo cal i taxtoriye di nafšo.	26244.mp3
She liked it, but said: „I’m afraid that it will be difficult and that I will not be able to continue.“	Rḥëmla, elo mërla: “Kozaycono howe casqo acli w lo qudrono mdawmono”.	26245.mp3
In the end she went to register at Leiden University, to study English language and culture with the aim to become a teacher.	Bi ḥarayto azza d makaṯwo ruḥa bu Beṯṣawbo d Leiden d quryo lišono Ënglišoyo w sëfroyuṯo b nišo d huyo malfoniṯo.	26246.mp3
Marta was a diligent student in high school. She always got good grades.	I Marta yolufto kašërto wa bi madrašto trayoniṯo. Kul naqla maydowa fuḥome ṭawwe.	26247.mp3
At Leiden University, after they saw her certificates and documents, they accepted her. She filled in the registration forms.	Bëṯër me d bu Beṯṣawbo d Leiden ḥzalle at tašrore w aw warqayḏa, maqëblalle. Mlela aw warqe du tëkṯiwo.	26251.mp3
Then she found a room through the internet in a village near Leiden.	Bëṯër cal u darbo du nawlo mqafelala qelayto bë qriṯo qaruto l Leiden.	26250.mp3
This is how Marta has become officially a student at Leiden University.	Hawxa i Marta hawyo rušmoyiṯ yolufto du Beṯṣawbo d Leiden.	26249.mp3
She will start studying in the coming academic year.	Bi šato du yulfono d ëṯyo gëd mšaryo bi qrayto.	26248.mp3
