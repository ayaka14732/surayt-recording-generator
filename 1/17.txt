It is forty years ago that the Be Marawge family arrived in the Netherlands.	Arbci ëšne šafici cal u maṯyo di iqarṯo d be Marawge l Holanda	25078.mp3
The children have grown up and studied in the Netherlands.	An nacime yariwi w qralle b Holanda	25079.mp3
They don’t know much about Turabdin, but they look forward to seeing the homeland.	Maḏco cal Ṭurcabdin latte ġäläbe, elo lhiqoye ne d ḥozën u aṯro.	28824.mp3
Simon is the youngest son of Saro and Aday. He is 18 years old.	U Simon, u abro zcuro di Saro w du Aday yo. Cëmre tmonacsar ëšne yo.	25083.mp3
One day he went to the Syriac association. On the door of the association, he saw a poster that drew his attention.	Ḥa yawmo azze lu ḥuḏro das Suryoye. Cal u tarco du ḥuḏro ḥzele warqo dë ­grëšla u zuhorayḏe.	25084.mp3
He got closer and read it. He saw that it was information concerning a journey to Turabdin.	Mqadamle w qëryole. Ḥzele d këtwa mawḏconuto cal mazlo l Ṭurcabdin.	25085.mp3
He then entered and said: “I would like to come as well, but I have to ask my parents first.“	Qayëm cabër w mërle: “Ono ste kobacno oṯeno, elo kolozam qamayto mšayalno me emi w babi.”	25086.mp3
In the evening Simon told his parents about the trip to Turabdin.	Caṣriye u Simon maḥkele li emo w lu babo cal u mazlo d Ṭurcabdin.	25087.mp3
His parents were very pleased.	I emo w u babo fṣiḥi ġäläbe.	25088.mp3
Simon went back to the association and said: „Register my name (please), I will join!“	U Simon dacër lu ḥuḏro w mërle: “Kṯawu ëšmi, aṯoyo no!”	25089.mp3
From then onwards he began asking his parents questions about Turabdin.	Mu yawmawo bdewayle dë mšayal šwole mi emo w mu babo cal Ṭur-cabdin.	25090.mp3
The organisation committee has arranged a rich programme for the trip to Turabdin.	I sicto mṭayboniṯo mḥaḏarla taḥrazto catërto lu mazlo d Ṭurcabdin.	25098.mp3
Simon has shown the programme to his parents. „Very nice“, they said.	U Simon maḥwele i taḥrazto li emo w lu babo. “Ġäläbe šafiro”, mërre.	25097.mp3
„From Amsterdam you will fly directly to Diyarbakir.	“Me Amsterdam gëd fayritu bi ṭayasto msawyo l Omiḏ.	25096.mp3
From Diyarbakir you will pass by Mardin and the Zaafaran Monastery, until you arrive in Turabdin, our homeland.	Me Omiḏ bi raḏayto gëd šëfcitu cal Marde w cal i dayro du Zacfäran hul d moṭitu l Ṭurcabdin u aṯrayḏan.	25095.mp3
You will visit all historical and famous places of Turabdin.	Gëd kërxitu ad dëkoṯe maxtabzabnoye w iḏice d Ṭurcabdin kulle.	25094.mp3
That is great. We believe that this will be a successful and nice trip.“	Ġäläbe ṭawwo. Komëtyaqnina gëd howe mazlo makëšrono w basimo.”	25093.mp3
Simon said: „I will take a lot of pictures, and after I return, I will tell you everything that I have seen and done.“	U Simon mërle “Gëd gorašno ṣërtoṯe ġäläbe, w me d dacërno gëd maḥkenanxu kul mede dë ḥzeli w sëmli.”	25092.mp3
Since that day, Simon could not wait for the summer holiday to travel to Turabdin.	Mu yawmawo u Simon law malḥaqwa d oṯe u bëṭlono du qayṭo w ëzze l Ṭurcabdin.	25091.mp3
